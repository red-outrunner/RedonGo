4. If your guess is too low, the game will prompt you to try a higher number.
5. If your guess is too high, the game will prompt you to try a lower number.
6. Continue guessing until you correctly guess the secret number.
7. Once you guess the number correctly, the game will display a congratulatory message along with the number of attempts it took you to guess correctly.
